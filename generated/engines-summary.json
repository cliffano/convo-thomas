      "Edward the Blue Engine is an anthropomorphic steam locomotive from The Railway Series children's books by the Rev W. Awdry, and the related TV Series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends. He is a blue 4-4-0 tender engine with red stripes, about the same size as James the Red Engine, and has the number 2 on his tender. Also like James, he is a mixed traffic engine, meaning that he can easily pull freight or passengers, though he prefers freight. He is one of the major characters in both the books and the television series. Edward is a kind engine, who is always keen to help a friend in need. The younger engines can always rely on him to lend a listening ear and sympathetic advice. He works hard and will always do his utmost to get a job done. However, the big engines tend to see him as old-fashioned and slow. But the smaller engines such as Thomas, Percy, Toby and Duck respect him greatly and will stick up for him at all times. It is true that he is one of the older engines on The Fat Controller's railway (indeed, he helped to build it), but he has proved time and time again that despite his age he is entirely capable of working as hard as any engine. Several of the stories revolving around him, both in the books and television series, have involved Edward proving his worth to the others. Two of the most notable were 'Old Iron', in which he earned himself an overhaul by capturing a runaway James, and 'Edward's Exploit', in which he brought home a special train despite a breakdown, caused by one of his coupling rods breaking. Edward has a branch line which he runs with BoCo, a diesel engine. Edward is equally happy with coaches or trucks, but he has also been known to help other engines with heavy loads, pull special trains and even act as a pilot engine for the Royal Train. Edward was first featured in The Three Railway Engines, Awdry's first book, in 1945. Edward featured in his own book, Edward the Blue Engine in 1954."

      "Emily the Stirling Engine is a steam locomotive from the television series Thomas & Friends. She was the first female steam engine to be featured in the television series (Mavis was the first female Diesel engine and female engine), and became a member of the \"Steam Team\", as the eight core characters of the series which she became in Calling All Engines!, and appeared in lots of episodes more often. She is also the only female in the Steam Team. She is painted dark green and has two large driving wheels and a shiny brass safety valve cover. She first appeared in the Series 7 episode \"Emily's New Coaches\". When she first arrived on the Island of Sodor, she took Thomas's coaches Annie and Clarabel by mistake, much to Thomas' dismay. However, after she rescued Thomas and Oliver from an accident, Thomas forgave her and The Fat Controller (Sir Topham Hatt) rewarded her with two coaches of her own. Emily acts as a sisterly figure to the other engines. She is very kind and friendly and always sensitive to the other engines' feelings. If she wrongs someone, knowingly or not, she is quick to apologize. She speaks with a Scottish accent in the U.K. narration of the series, while in the U.S. narration, she speaks with an American accent. Emily is the only member of the Steam Team who does not appear in The Railway Series—the series of books that have formed the basis of the television series, and she is also the only member in the Steam Team who was not created by the Rev. W. Awdry and his son, Christopher. As well as this, she is the only Steam Team member who did not make their first appearance in the first series. In the more recent (CGI) stories, from Hero of the Rails onwards, Emily is voiced by Teresa Gallagher (U.K.) and Jules de Jongh (U.S.)."

      "Henry the Green Engine is an anthropomorphic 4-6-0 steam locomotive from The Railway Series books written by the Reverend Wilbert Vere Awdry and his son, Christopher Awdry, and the spin-off children's television series, Thomas & Friends. Henry lives on the fictitious Island of Sodor with many other locomotives, including Thomas the Tank Engine. He is engine number 3 on the North Western Railway, and was one of the first engines to be described, appearing in the first book. Henry is a little smaller than Gordon the Big Engine, who also appeared in the first book. Henry's first (mis-)adventure was in \"The Sad Story of Henry\", the third story in the Railway Series book The Three Railway Engines. In this story, he went into a tunnel and refused to come out due to fears that the rain would spoil his paint. As punishment, the Fat Controller ordered that he was bricked up in the tunnel for eternity. Weeks later, he was eventually let out to help Edward pull Gordon's express train, after Gordon burst a safety valve. Henry was originally a failed prototype engine who, as the result of a small firebox (which was a similar shape to Gordon's), was often ill and a poor steamer. The Fat Controller gave him special Welsh coal, which helped. But worse was to come – Early one morning, Henry was pulling the fish express train, the Flying Kipper, when some frozen points diverted him in to a siding where he eventually crashed in to a goods train. This prompted the Fat Controller to send Henry to the engine works at Crewe so he could get a new shape and no longer need special coal. Henry has kept his so-called \"new shape\" through today. Henry was given a new firebox which gave him a similar specification to an LMS Class 5MT \"Black Five\" locomotive. This cured his illness completely. Henry now works on the main line. He can pull coaches and trucks equally well, and sometimes even hauls the Express when Gordon is not available. He is still the engine responsible for the Flying Kipper, and in the television series he also brings the post from the Mainland. He has been in the television series from the start, and in recent seasons has been identified as part of the Steam Team, the eight central characters. There have been two Railway Series books devoted to him, namely Henry the Green Engine and Henry and the Express."

      "James the Red Engine is a fictional anthropomorphic tender locomotive from The Railway Series children's books by the Rev. Wilbert Awdry, and the spin-off TV series Thomas & Friends. He is a mixed-traffic engine, which means he is just as capable of pulling coaches as trucks. He has a 2-6-0 (\"Mogul\") wheel arrangement and is engine number 5 on the North Western Railway, The Fat Controller's railway on the Island of Sodor. James first appeared in The Railway Series in 1946, in the book Thomas the Tank Engine. Two books in the series, no. 3 James the Red Engine and no. 28 James and the Diesel Engines, are dedicated to James. In the stories, James crashed into a field on his first day. The accident was blamed on his wooden brake blocks, which were thereafter replaced with metal ones. James has a reputation for being naughty. Some of his incidents include breaking a coach brake pipe and needing a passenger's bootlace and a newspaper to fix it, crashing into tar wagons, and spinning on the turntable although that was due to the wind rather than him. Despite his behavior, James is an engine proud of his red paint and shining brass dome, hard-working, and reliable and is generally considered to be a really useful engine. Adding to that, he also likes to stay clean. He hates pulling trucks, and believes that he should only be used to pull coaches. He thinks himself superior to the other engines, and can be shallow, boastful and arrogant – particularly to Edward, and those engines who appear old-fashioned, weak, slow or dirty. However, on a number of occasions, he has found himself forced to accept help from those he has insulted, and is ultimately apologetic. James is one of the few characters to have their own song in the TV series, the chorus of which is based on his theme music used in the early seasons. This song would be called \"James the Really Splendid Engine\", from the show's sixth season. In the Railway Series books, James was (for a long time) one of the last engines to retain a prejudice against diesels. However, he was forced to admit that there was nothing wrong with diesels as a whole in the book James and the Diesel Engines This, however, appears to be one of the few lessons that has stuck."

      "Percy the Small Engine is a fictional anthropomorphic steam engine from The Railway Series of children's books written by the Reverend Wilbert Vere Awdry and his son, Christopher Awdry. Percy also appears in the spin-off television series Thomas & Friends. Percy lives on the Island of Sodor with many other locomotives, including Thomas the Tank Engine, Gordon the Big Engine and Henry the Green Engine. He is the smallest, youngest and probably cheekiest, of the principal steam engine characters. He carries the number 6 on his bunker. The Fat Controller brought him to Sodor when there was an engine strike due to a shortage of shunting engines. The bigger engines initially tried to bully him, but Percy soon showed that he was more than capable of standing up for himself. After a few years of shunting at the Big Station, the Fat Controller promoted him to goods traffic on Thomas' branch line. When not pulling trucks, he can be seen pulling the post train or even taking Annie and Clarabel when Thomas is busy. Percy's best friends are Thomas and Toby. He is also known to have a great respect for Edward ever since his first appearance. He is reasonably experienced, but can still occasionally be a little naive and overconfident. In that sense, he is the perfect foil for Thomas – who can be just as headstrong. Percy's first appearance in The Railway Series was in book no. 5, Troublesome Engines, originally published in 1950. He was given his own title with book no. 11, Percy the Small Engine."

      "(This article is about the character. For the TV show the character appears in, see Thomas & Friends.) Thomas the Tank Engine is a small fictional steam locomotive in The Railway Series books by the Reverend Wilbert Awdry and his son, Christopher. He became the most popular character in the series, and is the title character in the accompanying television spin-off series, Thomas & Friends. Thomas is a steam engine and has a number 1 painted on his side. All of the locomotives in The Railway Series were based on prototypical engines; Thomas has origins in the E2 Class designed by Lawson Billinton in 1913. Thomas first appeared in 1946 in the second book in the series, Thomas the Tank Engine, and was the focus of the four short stories contained within. Thomas' best friends are Percy and Toby. In 1979, the British writer/producer Britt Allcroft came across the books, and arranged a deal to bring the stories to life as the TV series Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends (later simplified to Thomas & Friends). The program became an award-winning hit around the world, with a vast range of spin-off commercial products."
